# dairy-demand-forecasting
This project addresses inefficiencies in the dairy supply chain by using AI-based forecasting models to predict daily demand, optimize inventory, and reduce under- or overutilization of plant capacity. Through Python and time series forecasting models like Prophet and XGBoost, the system provides accurate product-level demand forecasts, categorizes plant utilization status, and alerts for potential stock or overload risks. The approach reduces wastage, enables smarter procurement, and ensures the dairy plant runs near optimal levels. Forecasts are presented in easy-to-read charts and CSV outputs, making it actionable for business use.
